        </p>
        <p class=paragraph> As you can see, I have spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out what I would like to complete in life.
        I have so many different thoughts, dreams, and ideas that sometimes I overload myself. Luckily with Software Development, 
        I think I'll be able to sit and focus as I look towards the future! In the next ten years, I hope to be an accomplished developer working 
        for a local company here in Central Oregon. I'm certain that if I put the time and effort into obtaining this skill, the rest of my desires
        will fall into place.
